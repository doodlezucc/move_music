  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="center">Last changed: February 6, 2021</p>
  <p>This page exists solely to ensure you I don't collect any data. Which also means I can't sell any. However, the
    same is not automatically guaranteed for the streaming services you log in to while using the app.</p>

  <h2>Interpretation</h2>
  <p>The words of which the initial letter is capitalized have meanings defined under the following conditions. The
    following definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether they appear in singular or in plural.
  </p>

  <h2>Definitions</h2>
  <p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:</p>
  <div class="list">
    <span>
      <p><b>Account</b> means a unique account created for You to access my Service or parts of my
        Service.</p>
    </span>
    <span>
      <p><b>Application</b> means the software program provided by the Company downloaded by You on any
        electronic device, named Move Music</p>
    </span>
    <span>
      <p><b>Creator</b> (referred to as either &quot;the Creator&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;Me&quot;
        or &quot;My&quot; in this Agreement) refers to <a href="https://github.com/doodlezucc">doodlezucc</a>, developer
        of the Application and co-owner of Theoretically Online.</p>
    </span>
    <span>
      <p><b>Personal Data</b> is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable
        individual.</p>
    </span>
    <span>
      <p><b>Service</b> refers to the Application.</p>
    </span>
    <span>
      <p><b>Third-party Social Media Service</b> refers to any website or any social network website
        through which a User can log in or create an account to use the Service.</p>
    </span>
    <span>
      <p><b>You</b> means the individual accessing or using the Service, or the company, or other legal
        entity on behalf of which such individual is accessing or using the Service, as applicable.</p>
    </span>
  </div>

  <h2>Third-party Personal Data Management</h2>
  <h3>YouTube Music</h3>
  <p>If You log in with a YouTube Account, the Application wants to get permission to <i>see, edit, and permanently
      delete Your YouTube videos, ratings, comments and captions</i>. Only Your subscriptions, created playlists and
    liked videos are received but <b>never</b> modified.</p>
  <p>My Service needs this data to work as one can't move or copy a thing they don't have access to. By signing into
    YouTube, You provide data which passes as a source to be moved or rather copied to another location, namely Your
    Spotify Account.
  </p>

  <h3>Spotify</h3>
  <p>If You log in with a Spotify Account, the Application wants to get <i>write/delete access to Your "Your Music"
      library</i>, <i>write access to your playlists</i> and <i>write/delete access to the list of artists and other
      users that You follow</i>. None of these are ever used to read or delete any of Your
    Spotify library contents.</p>
  <p>This also is, in all aspects, a crucial part of the Service. Without a provided Spotify Account, there is no
    destination to which Your liked videos or rather songs as well as other playlists and followed musicians can be
    copied to.</p>

  <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
  <p>My Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Me. If You click on a third party link,
    You will be directed to that third party's site. I strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every
    site You visit.</p>
  <p>I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third
    party sites or services.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>I may update my Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy
    Policy on this page.</p>
  <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are
    effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, You can contact me by email at
